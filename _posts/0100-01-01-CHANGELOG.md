  notes:
  - Support for Mapnik compositing at style level `comp-op` and feature level `polygon-comp-op` (porter-duff plus many more custom blend modes are supported)
  - Support for Mapnik image-filters like blur, emboss, and sharpen
  - Ability to turn on and off geometry clipping at feature level
  - Ability to smooth lines with `line-smooth`;
  - `marker-width` and `marker-height` are now expressions
  - `building-height` is now an expression
  - Added support for regex in carto filters like `#world[name =~ "A.*"]`
  - Added support for quotes in carto filter values like `#world[name2="Sa'ad"]`
  - Carto parsing now provides better errors for unmatched parens
  - Improved support for autodetection of geojson from the cartodb api (node-srs)
  - Added support for escaped URLs to remote datasources (for cartodb)
  - The raster-mode property has been renamed to raster-comp-op and now supports all SVG compositing operations (but uses dashes instead of underscores - so grain_merge is now grain-merge) (Mapnik)
  - Support for OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion)
  - OS X app is now signed with Developer ID (Gatekeeper)
  - Interactivity now works on features that have negative or zero primary key values
  - Fixed a bug where interactivity templates broke when they ended in a number value
  - Version update checking no longer blocks application startup.
  - Column names in CSV datasources named 'lng' are now automatically recognized as the longitude column
  - Added ability to zoom to layer extents
  - Added ability to toggle layer visibility
  - Added ability to trigger opening http links by clicking on features using 'location' template
  - Added ability to set the metatile size in the project settings
  - Added ability to set the Map `buffer-size` size in CartoCSS
  - Added support for http proxies
  - Added support for remote icons (millstone)
  - Improved support for handling remote csv and kml files (millstone)
  - Added more raster resampling methods like windowed filters of 'blackman' and 'hanning'
  - Added ability to upgrade plugins
  - Fixed a bug where compatible plugin versions did not show up if there were newer incompatible versions
  - TileMill now supports reading CSVs with a column named either 'WKT' or 'GEOJSON' and encoded as either Well Known Text or GeoJSON, respectively. This allows CSV files to support more geometry types than just points.
  - New Verbose mode for getting more detailed information in the TileMill logs of project loading status
  - Symlinks are now used on Windows Vista and above to speed up project loading and data handling efficiency
  - Data now should automatically update when a project is saved on Windows (no longer a need to rename the #id or filename)
  - SVG/PDF export with labels should work again on Windows
  - Support for filtering by geometry type like `#countries['mapnik::geometry_type'=polygon]`. Both `point`, `polygon`, `linestring`, and `collection` are supported keywords that match geometry types. Collection means that a feature stores mixed types, like both a `point` and a `polygon`.
