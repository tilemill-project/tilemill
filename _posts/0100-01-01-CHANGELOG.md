  notes:
  - Better error output in logs if a crash occurs during rendering or exports
  - Now using Node v0.6.15 (previous 0.9.0 release used Node v0.4.12)

  - Better reporting of Carto parse errors to UI
  - Faster exports by detecting solid tiles and avoiding duplicate encoding and storage
  - Faster refresh after saving (Mapnik)
  - Fully 64 bit build on OS X (duel 64/32bit support dropped)
  - Better support for GDAL rasters: notably larger rasters can be loaded now without hitting 'bad:alloc'
  - Supports zooming up to z22 (fixed by new Mapnik clipping and ModestMaps respecting project settings)
  - Now supports epsg projection syntax: so '+init=epsg:4326' can be used as shorthand for '+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs' (proj epsg lookup tables now packaged)
