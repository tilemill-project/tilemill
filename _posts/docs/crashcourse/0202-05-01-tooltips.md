### Tooltips

Tooltips allow you to make your maps interactive with dynamic content that appears when you hover over or click on your map. The tooltips can contain HTML and are useful for revealing additional data, images, or other content.

Previously, you [created a map of earthquakes](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/point-data). Here, you can add tooltips that reveal the magnitude, date and time of each quake when the user hovers over its point.

1. Open the **Templates** panel by clicking on the pointer button on the bottom left.

2. Click on the **Teaser** tab. **Teaser** content appears when you hover over a feature and **Full** content appears when you click on a feature. You can use the **Location** field to define a URL to be loaded when a feature is clicked.

3. Select the **earthquakes** layer to use it for interaction. TileMill only supports one interactive layer at a time.

4. The data fields for the layer are displayed wrapped in curly [Mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) tags. These tags will be replaced by data when you interact with the map. Locate the fields you want to use.

5. Write your template using the Mustache tags. Paste the following code into the **Teaser** field and use the preview to make sure it looks good:

       {{page.code1}}

6. Click **Save** to save your settings and refresh the map. Close the panel by clicking the close button (X) or pressing the ESC key. Move your mouse over some points to see the tooltips.

### Legends

The legend is placed permanently on a map and is useful for displaying titles, descriptions, and keys for what is being mapped. It can be styled using HTML, or it can simply contain an image.

Let's add a legend that describes the theme of your map.

1. Open the **Templates** panel by clicking on the pointer button in the bottom left.

2. The **Legend** tab is open by default.
  ![](/tilemill/assets/pages/legend-1.png)
3. Enter your legend text/html in the **Legend** field:

      {{page.code2}}<br>
  ![](/tilemill/assets/pages/legend-2.png)
4. Click **Save** and close the panel. You will now see your legend in the bottom right corner of the map.

<h3>Allowed HTML</h3>
For security, unsafe HTML in tooltips and legends are sanitized and JavaScript code is removed. If you want to build sophisticated map interaction with JavaScript on your own website, you can write custom code using the [Wax](http://mapbox.com/wax/) library.
