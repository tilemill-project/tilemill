TileMill uses a language called **Carto** to determine the look of your map. Colors, sizes and shapes can all be manipulated by applying their relative Carto parameters in the stylesheet panel to the right of the map. [Visit the manual](/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/) for an intro to Carto.

Previously, you [added an earthquake point layer](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/point-data) using the **Save & Style** button. This button automatically added several styling parameters to your stylesheet and gave them an initial value.

1. `#earthquakes`  
The layer to which the styles are applied.

2. `marker-width`  
The size of the markers. If `marker-height` is not specified, it is given the same value, resulting in a circle marker. Experiment by typing in a different number.

3. Click the **Save** button to save your project and trigger the map preview to update.

4. `marker-fill`  
The color of the inside of the marker. There are two methods for changing color values. You can type in a new value, or you can use the **color swatches** at the bottom of the Carto panel. Try changing the marker color by clicking the light red **swatch** and selecting a new color.

5. Click **Save** in the color picker to see your changes. Notice the corresponding color value is updated in the Carto.

6. `marker-line-color`  
The color of the border of the marker. This time try changing the color by replacing the hex value `#813` with `#000`, the code for black.

7. Click **Save**. Notice that the color swatch is updated with the new color.

8. `marker-allow-overlap`  
This allows markers to be placed on top of each other. If this is not specified or set to `false`, potentially overlapping markers will not be displayed.

### Conditional Styles

You can use conditional Carto styles to change the appearance of the points on your map based on attributes in the data. In the [tutorial on adding layers](/tilemill/docs/crashcourse/point-data), you created a map of earthquakes. Here, you can customize those earthquake points based on the magnitude of the quake.

1. Review the available data for the layer in the feature inspector.

2. Find the column called `Magnitude` and examine the range of values. This will help you decide how to scale the points.

3. Add the following Carto rule to the bottom of your stylesheet. This Carto rule sets a larger `marker-width` for features that have a larger `Magnitude` value.

        #earthquakes {
          [Magnitude >= 2.5] { marker-width:3; }
          [Magnitude >= 3]   { marker-width:4; }
          [Magnitude >= 3.5] { marker-width:5; }
          [Magnitude >= 4]   { marker-width:6; }
          [Magnitude >= 4.5] { marker-width:7; }
          [Magnitude >= 5]   { marker-width:8; }
          [Magnitude >= 5.5] { marker-width:9; }
          [Magnitude >= 6]   { marker-width:10; }
        }

4. Click **Save** to view your changes.
5. Use the map preview to confirm that the style is working. Adjust the Carto rule until you are satisfied.

These are just a few of the basic parameters for styling point data. For a comprehensive look at styling possibilities, checkout the **Carto reference** section in TileMill.
