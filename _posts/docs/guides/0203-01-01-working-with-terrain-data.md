To get good-looking terrain maps, we usually combine several types of visualizations generated by the GDAL DEM utilities.

For this tutorial we'll be processing geotiffs on the command-line. This requires the GDAL/OGR command line tools to be installed and available on your terminal user's $PATH.

Run the command `gdaldem --version` to check if you have GDAL installed. It should output something like `GDAL 1.7.3, released 2010/11/10` followed by a bunch of help text.

If you have not already installed GDAL then do so now. On Ubuntu this should be as easy as:

    sudo apt-get install gdal-bin

On Mac OS X you can install the "GDAL Complete" Framework from [kyngchaos.com](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks).

If you are using Mac OS X and you get `gdaldem: command not found`, you may need to add the GDAL program directory to your PATH - this can be done by running the following commands (you will only need to do this once):

    echo 'export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/GDAL.framework/Programs:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.bash_profile

## Digital Elevation Model sources

There are many different data formats for storing and working with digital elevation models. In our examples we'll be working with geotiffs. Here are some examples of high quality free datasets that are available in geotiff format:

#### STRM

Data collected from NASA's [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission][1] is a high quality source of elevation data covering much of the globe. It is available free from NASA directly, however we recommend working with [CGIAR's cleaned up version][2], which is also free. 

[1]: http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/
[2]: http://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/

We have also processed and combined CGIAR's cleaned up SRTM data and, with their permission, make it available as an Amazon Web Services *Elastic Block Store* (EBS) snapshot. If you have an AWS account, you can create an EBS volume from snapshot `snap-1861c070`, attach it to an EC2 instance, and work with it in the cloud instead of downloading hundreds of gigabytes of data.

#### ASTER

Aster is another global DEM datasource. It has better coverage of the earth's surface than SRTM, and is slightly higher-resolution, but contains more errors than CGIAR's clean SRTM set. Errors are usually in the form of spikes or pits, and can be significant.

#### USGS NED

The US Geological Survey publishes a [National Elevation Dataset][3] for the United States. It high resolution and frequently updated from a variety of sources.

## Types of Visualizations

#### Color-relief (or hypsometric tint)

![relief-example.png](/tilemill/assets/pages/relief-example.png)

Color relief assigns a color to a pixel based on the elevation of that pixel. The result is not intended to be hysically accurate, and even if natural-looking colors are chosen the results should not be interpreted as representative of actual landcover. Low-lying areas are often given assigned green and yellow shades, with higher elevations blending to shades of grey, white, and/or red. 

#### Hillshade (or shaded relief)

![hillshade-example.png](/tilemill/assets/pages/hillshade-example.png)

Hillshade visualization analyzes the digital elevation model to simulate a 3-dimensional terrain. The effect of sunlight on topography is not necessarily accurate but gives a good approximation of the terrain.

#### Slope

Slope visualization assigns a color to a pixel based on the difference in elevation between it and the pixels around it. We use it to make steep hills stand out and enhance the look of our terrain.

## Visualizations with GDAL-DEM

#### Reprojecting the Data

Chances are your DEM datasource will not come in the Google Mercator projection we need - for example, SRTM comes as [WGS84][] (EPSG:4326) and USGS NED comes as [NAD83][] (EPSG:4269).

[WGS84]: http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/
[NAD83]: http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4269/

For our example we'll be working with some NED data of the District of Columbia area. The following command will reproject the file to the proper projection - see [Reprojecting a GeoTIFF for TileMill][4] for more detailed information.

    gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4269 -t_srs EPSG:3785 -r bilinear dc.tif dc-3785.tif

In the case of reprojecting elevation data, the `-r bilinear` option is important because other resampling methods tend to produce odd stripes or grids in the resulting image.

#### Creating hillshades

Run this command to generate the shaded relief image:

    gdaldem hillshade -co compress=lzw dc-3785.tif dc-hillshade-3785.tif

The `-co compress=lzw` option will compress the TIFF. If you're not concerned about disk space you can leave that part out. Our output looks like this:

![Result, scaled and cropped](/tilemill/assets/pages/hillshade-dc.png)

**Note:** If there is not a 1:1 relation between your vertical and horizontal units, you will want to use the `-s` (scale) option to indicate the difference. Since Google Mercator X & Y units are meters, and NED elevation is also stored in meters this wasn't necessary for our example. If your elevation data is stored in feet, you might do this instead (since there are approximately 3.28 feet in 1 meter):

    gdaldem hillshade -s 3.28 -co compress=lzw dc-3785.tif dc-hillshade-3785.tif

#### Generating color-relief

Before you can create a color-relief image, you nee to decide what colors you want to assign to different elevations. This color configuration is created and stored in a specially formatted plain text file. Each line in the file should have four numbers - an elevation, and an RGB triplet of numbers from 0 to 255. To figure out the proper RGB values of a color, you can used the color selection tool of any image editor, or an online too such as [ColorPicker.com](http://www.colorpicker.com). 

Here is our example, saved to a file called ramp.txt:

    0 46 154 88
    1800 251 255 128
    2800 224 108 31
    3500 200 55 55
    4000 215 244 244

The above numbers define a gradient that will blend 5 colors over 4000 units of elevation. (Our units are meters, but we don't need to specify that in the file.) They will translate to a color-to-elevation relationship that looks like this:

![Ramp illustration](/tilemill/assets/pages/ramp-illustration-fs8.png)

To apply this color ramp to the DEM, use the `gdaldem color-relief` command:

    gdaldem color-relief input-dem.tif ramp.txt output-color-relief.tif

The area you are working with may not have such a wide range of elevations. You can check the minimum & maximum values of your DEM to adjust your ramp style accordingly. The `gdalinfo` command can tell us the range of values in the geotiff:

    gdalinfo -stats your_file.tif

Among other things, this will tell you the minimum, maximum, and mean values of your elevation data to help you make decisions about how to choose your colors. With elevations tweaked for our area around DC, this is what we get:

![color-dc.png](/tilemill/assets/pages/color-dc.png)

#### Generating slope shading

With the gdaldem tools, generating a slope visualization is a two step process. 

First, we generate a slope tif where each pixel value is a degree, from 0 to 90, representing the slope of a given piece of land. 

    gdaldem slope dc-3785.tif dc-slope-3785.tif

*The same note about horizontal and vertical scale as hillshades applies for slope.*

The tif output by `gdaldem slope` has no color values assigned to pixels, but that can be achieved by feeding it through gdaldem color-relief with an appropriate ramp file. 

Create a file called 'slope-ramp.txt' containing these two lines:

    0 255 255 255
    90 0 0 0

This file can then be referenced by by the color-relief command to display white where there is a slope of 0° (ie, flat) and display black where there is a 90° cliff (with angles in-between being various shades of grey). The command to do this is:

    gdaldem color-relief -co compress=lzw dc-slope-3785.tif slope-ramp.txt dc-slopeshade-3785.tif

Which gives us:

![dc-slope.png](/tilemill/assets/pages/dc-slope.png)

## Combining the final result in TileMill

To combine these geotiffs in TileMill, we'll make use of the 'multiply' image blending mode. Assuming you have added your three geotiffs as layers with appropriate IDs, the following style will work. You can adjust the opacity of the hillshade and slope layers to tweak the style.

    #color-relief,
    #slope-shade,
    #hill-shade {
        raster-scaling: bilinear;
        raster-mode: multiply;
    }
    
    #hill-shade { raster-opacity: 0.6; }
    
    #slope-shade { raster-opacity: 0.4; }

The end result is something like this, ready to be combined with your vector data:
