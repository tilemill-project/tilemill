This documentation covers TileMill installation for developers. For most users, the [installation instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/install) will be more appropriate.

## Install dependencies

### Mac OS X

Install the following dependencies first:

- [Xcode 3](https://connect.apple.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/MemberSite.woa/wa/getSoftware?bundleID=20792) or [Xcode 4](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id448457090?mt=12)
- [Mapnik 2.1.0-pre - 113f3937cf](https://github.com/mapnik/mapnik/commit/113f3937cfa3cb37f9b390607338f0ce0c8c4508) or higher
- [Node.js][node] 0.6.x (with included npm)

Note: if you are installing TileMill from its master branch (rather than the latest tagged release) then you may need a more recent version of Mapnik than listed above (which is the version used for the latest tag).

### Ubuntu Linux

These instructions work for Ubuntu >= 10.10.

Install TileMill dependencies:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential libwebkit-dev

Add the MapBox PPA (which includes mapnik and nodejs packages):

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:developmentseed/mapbox
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install libmapnik libmapnik-dev mapnik-utils nodejs nodejs-dev npm


Note: if you are installing TileMill from its master branch you may need a more recent Node.js and Mapnik. The latest versions of Node.js can be fetched from the `ppa:chris-lea/node.js` PPA. And the latest versions of Mapnik can be fetched from the `ppa:mapnik/nightly-trunk` PPA. These are the repositories we copy from to populate the `ppa:developmentseed/mapbox` PPA before releasing a TileMill tagged version.

## Building TileMill

Run the following from a terminal to check out a development copy of TileMill and build it from source.

    git clone https://github.com/mapbox/tilemill.git
    cd tilemill
    npm install

Upon a successful build npm will output a dependency tree as an ascii diagram. If there was an error npm tends to hang and hitting enter will return to a command prompt. To see the error run `npm install` again (since the error in the first run will be buried in interleaved build output). If the error has to do with node-mapnik then you likely have a Mapnik version that is too old.

Once the build is complete you can start TileMill with the following command from the `tilemill` directory:

    ./index.js


See the [Ubuntu Service page]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/guides/ubuntu-service/) for details about running a headless server without a UI.

### Updating

To update your development copy of TileMill clean your copy and rebuild:

    # From the `tilemill` directory
    git pull
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm install
