### IMPORTANT - If you already have a version of mapnik installed, such as
### a version you compiled while installing a previous version of TileMill
### you must uninstall that version of mapnik in order to be able to use
### the packaged version of TileMill.  To uninstall, for example, go to
### the directory from where you installed mapnik, such as 
### /home/ubuntu/mapnik and from within that directory run
### `sudo make uninstall` to uninstall that version of mapnik.
### If you install the packaged version of TileMill using this script and
### then you see segmentation fault errors in the TileMill log in
### /var/log/tilemill/tilemill.log, then chances are you have a previously
### compiled version of mapnik, in addition to the mapnik package required
### and which will be installed for you using this script.
